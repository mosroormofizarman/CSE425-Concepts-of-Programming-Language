1. **Language Fundamentals** – Categories, design principles, evolution
2. **Syntax and Semantics** – Formal definitions, lexical and syntax analyzers
3. **Names and Bindings** – Type checking, scoping rules
4. **Data Types** – Abstract data types, type systems
5. **Expressions and Statements** – Control structures, subprograms
6. **Object-Oriented Programming** – Paradigm principles and implementations
7. **Concurrency** – Control mechanisms and parallel programming
8. **Functional Programming** – Principles and language examples
9. **Logic Programming** – Principles and applications
